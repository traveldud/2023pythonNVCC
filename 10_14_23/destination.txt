ACT I.

SCENE I.--ELSINORE. A PLATFORM BEFORE THE CASTLE. NIGHT.

  FRANCISCO _on his post. Enter to him_ BERNARDO (L.H.)

  _Ber._ Who's there?

  _Fran._ (R.) Nay, answer me:[1] stand, and unfold[2] yourself.

  _Ber._ Long live the king![3]

  _Fran._                   Bernardo?

  _Ber._                             He.

  _Fran._ You come most carefully upon your hour.

  _Ber._ 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

  _Fran._ For this relief much thanks:

    [_Crosses to_ L.]

                                      'tis bitter cold,
  And I am sick at heart.

  _Ber._ Have you had quiet guard?

  _Fran._                         Not a mouse stirring.

  _Ber._ Well, good night.
  If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
  The rivals of my watch,[4] bid them make haste.

  _Fran._ I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who's there?

  _Hor._ Friends to this ground.

  _Mar._                        And liegemen to the Dane.[5]

    _Enter_ HORATIO _and_ MARCELLUS (L.H.)

  _Fran._ Give you good night.

  _Mar._                      O, farewell, honest soldier:
  Who hath reliev'd you?

  _Fran._ Bernardo hath my place.
  Give you good night.

    [_Exit_ FRANCISCO, L.H.]

  _Mar._         Holloa! Bernardo!

  _Ber._                          Say,
  What, is Horatio there?

  _Hor._ (_Crosses to_ C.) A piece of him.[6]

  _Ber._ (R.) Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

  _Hor._ What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

  _Ber._ I have seen nothing.

  _Mar._ (L.) Horatio says, 'tis but our fantasy,
  And will not let belief take hold of him,
  Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
  Therefore I have entreated him, along
  With us, to watch the minutes of this night;[7]
  That, if again this apparition come,
  He may approve our eyes,[8] and speak to it.

  _Hor._ Tush! tush! 'twill not appear.

  _Ber._ Come, let us once again assail your ears,
  That are so fortified against our story,
  What we two nights have seen.[9]

  _Hor._ Well, let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

  _Ber._ Last night of all,
  When yon same star that's westward from the pole
  Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
  Where now it burns, Marcellus, and myself,
  The bell then beating one--

  _Mar._ Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes
  again!

    _Enter_ Ghost (L.H.)

  _Ber._ In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

  _Hor._ Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.[10]

  _Ber._ It would be spoke to.

  _Mar._ Speak to it, Horatio.

  _Hor._ What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,[11]
  Together with that fair and warlike form
  In which the majesty of buried Denmark
  Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!

  _Mar._ It is offended.

      [Ghost _crosses to_ R.]

  _Ber._                See! it stalks away!

  _Hor._ Stay!--speak!--speak, I charge thee, speak!

                          [_Exit_ Ghost, R.H.]

  _Mar._ 'Tis gone, and will not answer.

  _Ber._ How now, Horatio! You tremble, and look pale:
  Is not this something more than fantasy?
  What think you of it?

  _Hor._ Before heaven, I might not this believe,
  Without the sensible and true avouch[12]
  Of mine own eyes.

  _Mar._           Is it not like the king?

  _Hor._ As thou art to thyself:
  Such was the very armour he had on,
  When he the ambitious Norway combated.

  _Mar._ Thus, twice before, and jump at this dead hour,[13]
  With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

  _Hor._ In what particular thought to work,[14] I know not;
  But in the gross and scope[15] of mine opinion,
  This bodes some strange eruption to our state.[16]
  In the most high and palmy[17] state of Rome,
  A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
  The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.

    _Re-enter_ Ghost (R.H.)

  But, (L.C.) soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
  I'll cross it, though it blast me.

    [HORATIO _crosses in front of the_ Ghost _to_ R.
    Ghost _crosses to_ L.]

                                    Stay, illusion!
  If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,[18]
  Speak to me:
  If there be any good thing to be done,
  That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,
  Speak to me:
  If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
  Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
  O, speak!
  O, if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
  Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,[19]
  For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
  Speak of it:--stay, and speak!

    [_Exit_ Ghost, L.H.]

  _Mar._ 'Tis gone!
  We do it wrong, being so majestical,
  To offer it the show of violence.

  _Ber._ It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

  _Hor._ And then it started like a guilty thing
  Upon a fearful summons.[20] I have heard,
  The cock, that is the trumpet of the morn,
  Doth with his lofty[21] and shrill-sounding throat
  Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
  Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
  The extravagant and erring spirit[22] hies
  To his confine.
  But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
  Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastern hill:
  Break we our watch up; and, by my advice,
  Let us impart what we have seen to-night
  Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
  This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

    [_Exeunt_, L.H.]


SCENE II.--A ROOM OF STATE IN THE PALACE.

    _Trumpet March._

    _Enter the_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _preceded by_ POLONIUS, HAMLET,
    LAERTES,[23] Lords, Ladies, _and_ Attendants.

  _King._ (R.C.) Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
  The memory be green;[24] and that it us befitted
  To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
  To be contracted in one brow of woe;
  Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature,
  That we with wisest sorrow[25] think on him,
  Together with remembrance of ourselves.
  Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
  The imperial jointress of this warlike state,
  Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,[26]
  Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd[27]
  Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
  With this affair along:--For all, our thanks.
  And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
  You told us of some suit; What is't, Laertes?

  _Laer._ (R.)                   My dread lord,
  Your leave and favour[28] to return to France;
  From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
  To show my duty in your coronation,
  Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
  My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
  And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

  _King._ Have you your father's leave? What says Polonious?

  _Pol._ (R.) He hath, my lord, (wrung from me my slow leave
  By laboursome petition; and, at last,
  Upon his will I sealed my hard consent):[29]
  I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

  _King._ Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
  And thy best graces spend it at thy will![30]
  But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,----

  _Ham._ (L.) A little more than kin, and less than kind.[31]

    [Aside.]

  _King._ How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

  _Ham._ Not so, my lord; I am too much i'the sun.[32]

  _Queen._(L.C.) Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour[33] off,
  And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
  Do not for ever with thy vailed lids[34]
  Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
  Thou know'st 'tis common, all that live must die,
  Passing through nature to eternity.

  _Ham._ Ay, madam, it is common.

  _Queen._                          If it be,
  Why seems it so particular with thee?

  _Ham._ Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not seems.
  'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
  Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,
  No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
  Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
  That can denote me truly: These, indeed, seem,
  For they are actions that a man might play.
  But I have that within which passeth show;[35]
  These but the trappings[36] and the suits of woe.

  _King._ 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
  To give these mourning duties to your father:
  But, you must know, your father lost a father;
  That father lost, lost his;[37] and the survivor bound,
  In filial obligation, for some term
  To do obsequious sorrow:[38] But to pers√©ver[39]
  In obstinate condolement,[40] is a course
  Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief:
  It shows a will most incorrect to Heaven.[41]
  We pray you, throw to earth
  This unprevailing[42] woe; and think of us
  As of a father: for let the world take note,
  You are the most immediate to our throne;
  Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

  _Queen._ Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
  I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

  _Ham._ I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
